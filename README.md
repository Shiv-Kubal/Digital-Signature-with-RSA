# Digital-Signature-with-RSA

Digitally signing and verifying a message block with RSA and SHA-256 in python. Created a digital signature for a message by computing the hash value of the message using SHA-256 and then encrypting it with RSA private key. The objectives of the project were to examine asymmetric cryptography used in digital signatures and see how they protect the authenticity and integrity of public transactions in the Blockchains.
